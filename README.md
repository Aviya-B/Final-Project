# Final-Project
## New Lab tools for Communication Interference Simulation
In order to discover new means of overcoming communication interference, we will development new tools capable of quantifying and evaluating communication interference.  <br>
The development of new devices (e.g., routers) based on these tools and all the communication interference will take into account.

### General milestones:
- Preparation stage:<br>

   Learning disorders in electrical devices (eg Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)
- Development stage<br>

  Simulation of Wi-Fi interference by Matlab simulation system
  
- Testing stage<br>
